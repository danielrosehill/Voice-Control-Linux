Okay, so today is the 18th of December 2025. And the purpose of these notes is to gather together context data in order to describe what I want to achieve or what I'm, let's say, the aspirational target for voice control technology for Linux on the one hand, and the other hand to see what's out there at the moment. So I'm going to describe in sort of as. As much detail as I can what would be immense or what would be the holy grail of voice control for Linux, as it were. So in terms of things that I've discovered in the last year using voice tech very intensively, is that I have solutions for voice typing. They're not perfect, but they are some large part of the way towards what I'm looking for. The challenge really is. So I'm using. I've created my own tool for voice note taking, which is something that still feels a bit alien to me, vibe coding my own tools instead of using an existing one. But because my needs, I guess, are quite specific, I found success very much with this approach for voice text. So it's a voice notepad, it uses Gemini Google multimodal. And the utility of this over using Whisper is for my use case at least very significant. Instead of just directly capturing text, which I don't want to have all my verbal tics and you know, you know, right. That's something that AI described as a verbal tick and it's something I don't want to have in the transcript. I don't need, you know, and I don't need m. So because this is the case, I created a multimodal thing that does that level of cleanup and then it can also do second level of cleanup, which is going to the next formatting. So it's kind of a layered approach. You start with a basic layer of text cleaning, text sanitization, you might call it removing filler words, removing ems, removing things that don't need to be in the transcript. Next layer is stylistic edits and you can stop at level one, but if you want to build the layers up, then you can do. I want this to be formal, I want this to be. It's interpersonal communication for friends, therefore it should actually be informal. Layer three, it needs to be more enthusiastic, more persuasive. So it's kind of building layers upon the prompt. And what I found is that this works. And getting virtual keyboard input is actually the hard part here because for obvious reasons, keyboard entry at the OS is very sensitive. It can be used maliciously as a Big security concern. And it's an unfortunate consequence of this that because the security controls are so tight that it can be very hard to actually get a virtual input keyboard to work as you may wish. What I want is really to be able to type into any field in the computer, and that level of operation is possible. I've seen it work with the Deepgram Linux voice keyboards utility, but unfortunately it is a bit challenging. So my implementation so far has worked extremely well at the note level. I've had proof of concept success at that level, and that alone is a significant amount of progress. It means that it can relieve me of 80% typing, let's say, no, maybe 70%. I don't need to type emails, I don't need to type these things. I can just use my voice, capture the text that comes out of that. With audio multimodal, I get to the next step of it having paragraph punctuation. I've even added to my proof of concept app the ability to provide your name as a user setting so that if I choose an email as the target format, it will even have my signature. So I'm getting very close to voice typing for, you know, as the heavyweight text entry. Now, what it doesn't do, and this is what I'm looking for in the accessory component, if you will, is the ability to control the computer. So currently I'm working on Ubuntu 2510 and I have three screens in front of me as I record this. This is my daily workstation where I get 80% of my work done. I barely use my laptop, I barely use my phone for work. I'm kind of either. I'm kind of working here on a client site discussing or showing something on my laptop, but rarely, rarely these days doing even work on a client site. This is like my center of operations. My home desktop and everything else is kind of peripheral to that. So this is where I'd want my voice control to be here basically. And I have a headset I'm speaking into and I just lack the layer to do that. But what I don't want as well, and the reason I mention my voice tech and what it does, or my voice keyboard is because for voice, I think this has to be a unified solution. You know, I don't have a voice keyboard up and a voice control tool up, especially because there's an overlap in terms of vad. There is an overlap in terms of like they can't really. They can coexist very easily. It's better, it's better to have one, let's say voice module that's doing all these things than it is to try run two things in parallel because they're going to conflict. So for the, the voice control thing, I mean basically it would involve on any given day, in any given time it would be. So with my three screens here it would be like, okay, I have a code editor on the left. In the center of the screen I have my personal Chrome profile and on the right screen I have my work Chrome profile. And that's pretty typical. So things I would like to do, okay, close out the code editor, open a new tab in the personal thing, open this URL in the personal Chrome profile, close out the business profile, open this. And then in Linux, two tools that I'm constantly touching will be the file manager and the terminal. And these days claude, Claude I'm using actually Claude code, Claude CLI and it's a terminal product and I'm using it not I think what it's actually really built for, but I'm using it constantly for local system optimization and operation. So I'll open Claude and I'll say like can we check why ComfyUI isn't launching? And I'm using it just mostly at this level of computer control. I'm working also on code bases, but just as commonly or probably even more commonly actually as a control interface for the computer which actually I think is a huge step towards this idea being feasible and viable because that's the excellent bridge between natural language and executing commands. And I think that when we look at computer control and cuas there is, you know, I've used visual based approaches where you use computer vision and object detection and I haven't had much success with them. I've seen that this agentic level operating at the command execution level has actually been much, much more reliable and successful and it avoids a lot of the complication of you know, having to have something that literally tries to take screen grabs and understand your screen. I think there's a privacy risk in that too. That actually makes me quite uncomfortable. So I'm already using, I already am using Claude as that intermediary on a 12 gigabyte vram machine. I'm not sure, there's kind of a quick fill in from open source that could be used instead of it, but you know, potentially so basically on any. I think the ultimate tool that I'm looking for maybe is something that has to be cobbled together myself, in which case these are, this is context data and spec notes trying to bring in together these components into one cohesive system. But sort of the, you know, the ideal situation might be that it's running as a boot process. I say, okay, let's open up my personal chrome, let's go to this website. I want to type an email to this person. And then there is. Once we sort of shift into that phase, now we're out of command execution and now we're into dictation. And that there's a seamless flow between those two parts. And then I move on, because that would encompass probably 99% of the workday besides maybe time spent in meetings, in which case maybe there's like a pause command so that you can say I'm like, go to sleep, as it were, stop the wake, word this action. I'm in a meeting now, but when I'm out of the meeting, we're back to commands dictation all the way through to turn off the computer or snooze the computer. And that would be everything that it does. So I'd love to get a sense for what's currently there in terms of computer control technologies, computer use technologies, and see survey, and then I can sort of make a better informed decision as to how I might get from A to B.
